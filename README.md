# Requirements
You must use the lastest stable [PPSSPP](https://www.ppsspp.org/download) build.

PPSSPP `Settings>graphics>render resolution` must be set at 4x or above. (Recommend 6x)


# Automatic Installation
- Open the zip file within PPSSPP as if it were a game.

*Please note using this method will prioritize your last opened ISO region. So if you have multiple copies of FFT from different regions open the version that you would like the texture pack to be applied to before installing. If you have never opened FFT in your PPSSPP it will default to a EUROPE install.*

# Manual Installation
- In your PPSSPP directory, navigate to `memstick/PSP/TEXTURES`.
